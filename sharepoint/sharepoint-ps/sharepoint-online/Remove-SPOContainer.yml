  The `Remove-SPOContainer` cmdlet deletes a File Storage Container and puts it in the Recycle Bin. A Container that is deleted will no longer be retrieved by the [`Get-SPOContainer`](./Get-SPOContainer.yml) cmdlet.

  When admins delete a Container, it is moved into the Recycle Bin. A deleted Container can be [restored](./Restore-SPODeletedContainer.yml) from the Recycle Bin within 93 days. If a Container is deleted from the Recycle Bin, or it exceeds the 93-day retention period, it is permanently deleted. Deleting a Container deletes everything within it, including all documents and files. You can view all deleted Containers in the Recycle Bin with the [`Get-SPODeletedContainer`](./Get-SPODeletedContainer.yml) cmdlet.

  You must be at least a SharePoint Online administrator to run the cmdlet.
