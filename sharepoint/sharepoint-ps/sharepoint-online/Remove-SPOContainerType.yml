  This cmdlet deletes only the trial container type in the tenant. To delete a container type in trial status, you must remove all containers of the container type first, including from the deleted container collection. To remove containers, refer to [Remove-SPOContainer](./Remove-SPOContainer.yml). Once all the containers are deleted, trial container type can be deleted using this cmdlet.

  You must be a SharePoint Embedded Administrator to run this cmdlet.
