  Allows for the specified site to be prioritized. 

  As part of [Advanced Tenant Rename](/sharepoint/change-your-sharepoint-domain-name#advanced-tenant-rename-preview), organizations can prioritize up to 4,000 sites for initial execution among all other sites in your organization as part of the overall rename operation.

  It is possible to start prioritizing sites only once the rename operation has been scheduled using the [Start-SPOTenantRename](Start-SPOTenantRename.yml) cmdlet.

  Please note that prioritizing a site is not a guarantee that it will complete first. There are several factors that can affect processing times, and multiple site renames are processed in parallel. Prioritized sites have a much higher chance of completing first.

  You must be at least a SharePoint administrator to run the cmdlet.
