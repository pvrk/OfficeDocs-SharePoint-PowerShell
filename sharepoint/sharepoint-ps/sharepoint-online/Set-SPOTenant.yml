This parameter can only be called if the AI builder model's scope is set to `SelectedSites`.

    This parameter allows administrators to pass a list of SharePoint site URLs to modify the AI builder model and [structured and freeform document processing](/microsoft-365/syntex/form-processing-overview) premium feature's selected sites list. By default this parameter overwrites the existing list with the user input list. Additionally, the `AIBuilderModelSelectedSitesListOperation` parameter can be used to specify a different operation. This parameter can only be called if the AI builder model's scope is set to `SelectedSites`. The inputted list of site URLs cannot exceed 100 items.

    > [!NOTE]

    The valid values are:

    - `Overwrite`: Overwrite the existing selected sites list. This is the default operation.
    - `Append`: Append the input list of sites to the existing selected sites list.
    - `Remove`: Remove the input list of sites from the existing selected sites list.

  name: AllowAnonymousMeetingParticipantsToAccessWhiteboards
  description: |+
    When you share a whiteboard in a Teams meeting, Whiteboard creates a sharing link. This link is accessible by anyone within the organization. The whiteboard is also shared with any in-tenant users in the meeting. Whiteboards are shared using company-shareable links, regardless of the default setting. Support for the default sharing link type is planned.

    There's more capability for temporary collaboration by external and shared device accounts during a Teams meeting. Users can temporarily view and collaborate on whiteboards that are shared in a meeting, in a similar way to PowerPoint Live sharing.

    In this case, Whiteboard provides temporary viewing and collaboration on the whiteboard during the Teams meeting only. A share link isn't created and Whiteboard doesn't grant access to the file.

    If you have external sharing enabled for OneDrive for Business, no further action is required.

    If you restrict external sharing for OneDrive for Business, you can keep it restricted, and just enable this new setting in order for external and shared device accounts to work. For more information, see [Manage sharing for Microsoft Whiteboard](/microsoft-365/whiteboard/manage-sharing-organizations).

  name: BlockDownloadFileTypePolicy
  description: |+
    You can block the download of Teams meeting recording files from SharePoint or OneDrive. This allows users to remain productive while addressing the risk of accidental data loss. Users have browser-only access to play the meeting recordings with no ability to download or sync files or access them through apps.

    This policy applies to new meeting recordings across the entire organization. You can exempt people who are members of specified security groups from the policy. This allows you to specify governance or compliance specialists who should have download access to meeting recordings.

    After the policy is turned on, any new Teams meeting recording files created by the Teams service and saved in SharePoint and OneDrive are blocked from download.

    Because this policy affects meeting recordings stored in OneDrive and SharePoint, you must be a SharePoint administrator to configure it.

    Note that this policy doesn't apply to manually uploaded meeting recording files. For more details, see [Block the download of Teams meeting recording files from SharePoint or OneDrive](/microsoftteams/block-download-meeting-recording).

    To disable a specific web part, you need to enter its GUID as the parameter.

  name: EnableAutoExpirationVersionTrim
  description: |+
    Global and SharePoint Administrators can set organization-level version history limits settings that universally apply to new versions created on all new document libraries created in your organization. 

    When version history limits are managed automatically, SharePoint employs an algorithm behind the scenes that deletes (thins out) intermittent older versions that are least likely to be needed, while preserving sufficient high-value versions - more versions in the recent past and fewer farther back in time - in case restores are required.

    The valid values are: 

    - True - Version history limits for new versions created on all new document libraries in your organization will be managed automatically.
    - False - Version history limits for new Versions created on all new document libraries in your organization will be managed manually by setting limits to the number of major versions (`MajorVersionLimit`) and time set (`ExpireVersionsAfterDays`). Review the documentation of both parameters to manage your organization's version limits manually.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When version history limits are managed manually (`EnableAutoExpirationVersionTrim $false`), `MajorVersionLimit` and `ExpireVersionsAfterDays` are both required parameters with the following acceptable values:
    > a. `MajorVersionLimit` accepts values from 1 through 50,000 (inclusive).
    > b. `ExpireVersionsAfterDays` accepts values of 0 to Never Expire or values >= 30 to delete versions that exceed that time period.
    > When version history limits are managed automatically (`EnableAutoExpirationVersionTrim $true`), setting `MajorVersionLimit` or `ExpireVersionsAfterDays` will result in an error as the count limits are set by the service.

  name: SignInAccelerationDomain
  description: |+
    Specifies the home realm discovery value to be sent to Microsoft Entra ID during the user sign-in process.

    When the organization uses a third-party identity provider, this prevents the user from seeing the Microsoft Entra Home Realm Discovery web page and ensures the user only sees their company's Identity Provider's portal.
    This value can also be used with Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 to customize the Microsoft Entra sign-in page.

    Acceleration will not occur on site collections that are shared externally.

    This value should be configured with the login domain that is used by your company (that is, example@contoso.com).

    If your company has multiple third-party identity providers, configuring the sign-in acceleration value will break sign-in for your organization.

    The valid values are:  

    - "" (default) - Blank by default, this will also remove or clear any value that has been set.  
    - Login Domain - For example: "contoso.com"

  name: SyncAadB2BManagementPolicy
  description: |+
    This feature allows SharePoint Online to synchronize several Entra B2B collaboration settings [Guest user access restriction and collaboration restriction](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/external-collaboration-settings-configure#configure-settings-in-the-portal), and store them on SharePoint Online tenant store. On sharing, SharePoint checks whether those synchronized settings are blocking sharing before sending invitation requests to Entra B2B invitation manager. The sync might take up to 24 hours to complete if you change those Entra B2B collaboration settings. To make the change effective on SharePoint Online immediately, run 'Set-SPOTenant -SyncAadB2BManagementPolicy $true' and it forces a sync from Microsoft Entra.

  name: UsePersistentCookiesForExplorerView
  description: |+
    > [!NOTE]
    > This setting is not used anymore with Internet Explorer (IE) retired and the parameter would be removed soon. Users need to select "Yes" when prompted for "Stay signed in?" at the time of sign-in for "View in File Explorer" to work with Microsoft Edge. 

    Lets SharePoint issue a special cookie that will allow this feature to work even when "Keep Me Signed In" is not selected.

    "Open with Explorer" requires persisted cookies to operate correctly.
    When the user does not select "Keep Me Signed in" at the time of sign-in, "Open with Explorer" will fail.

    This special cookie expires after 30 minutes and cannot be cleared by closing the browser or signing out of SharePoint Online.
    To clear this cookie, the user must log out of their Windows session.

    The valid values are:  

    - False (default) - No special cookie is generated and the normal Office 365 sign-in length/timing applies.  
    - True - Generates a special cookie that will allow "Open with Explorer" to function if the "Keep Me Signed In" box is not checked at sign-in.
